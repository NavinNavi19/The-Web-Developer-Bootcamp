      <h1>About Me</h1>
        
      <h4>Greetings,</h4>
        
      <p>This is Navin from an IT security industry background for over a year and half as a Security Adiministrator.I am a Tech Enthusiast and also love to stay updated in the world of technology. I have started this website in the view of sharing my technical knowledge, personal experiences in parallel my learning.</p>
        
      <p>With that said above, I have a little knowledge about basic programming also. But first when I decided to open a blog, I was put into a situation where I was not able to customize website to my needs. Because Wordpress and many other CMS have free blogging template but written in advanced HTML, CSS and PHP webpage template(well atleast I felt that way). So I started learning and developing web pages during the day and break them in the night to exploit the vulnerabilities. I hopw to update the contents and the look of this webpage on a weekly basis.</p>
        
	  <p>I hope you will find something worth your time.</p>
        
      <h3>Thoughts Become Things</h3>
  
<!––First Post––>
       
        <h1>What is git and how to use it effectively</h1>
         
            <ul>

        <h3>What is Git?</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Git is <strong>version control system</strong> that means it stores and creates a timeline of all your changes done to the code.</li>
                <li>This allows you to return to your code when something gets messy or when needed to look at something that you did previously.</li>
            </ul>
 
        <h3>What is GitHub?</h3>
        
            <ul>
                <li>GitHub is a <strong>cloud code hosting platform</strong> for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. It's a go to place for most of the open source projects.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        
        <img src="img/working.png" alt="Three areas of git">
