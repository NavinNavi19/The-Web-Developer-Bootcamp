# What advice wouldyou give a new developer?


### "get comfortable with feeling uncomfortable/lost/confused"


### "it's important to actually do the homework. It helps to retain new information and gives you a chance to practice!"


### "the problem isn't solving the problem, it's figuring out how to find the answer."


### "Don't just focus on learning syntax but make sure you understand the concepts"


### "Write a list describing the kind of developer you want to be and what you want to be an expert at(sometimes it helps to look at your dream jobs role descriptions). Make sure that you set aside a little bit of time every week to work on one small thing on the side that addresses that(whether itâ€™s reading about CSS mark-up or making a miniapp using a non- relational database, doing a one hour tutorial on how to use redis etc)"

### "my advice would be to not be intimidated, everyone starts somewhere"


### "Colt can be bribed using puppies and japanese candy. Use this advice wisely"
