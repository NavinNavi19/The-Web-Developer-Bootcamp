## Finding the Right Address

```
Your query is submitted to your ISP
Within your ISP, the DNS takes the Domain name and
turns it into an IP address
```
```
http://www.udemy.com 23.235.47.
```

## Going to that Address

- A request is sent to the desired IP address via HTTP
- Your request finds the fastest path possible path to
the server with the specified IP
- This is not a direct journey. It requires hoping from
server to server until we arrive

## Udemy Server Responds

- The requested server figures out exactly what we're
asking for(/courses)
- The server builds us the right content, often pulling
information from database
- The server responds with any combination of HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript

on any webpage
