# JQuery Notes

- It is a DOM Manipulation Library
- Also fast Javascript Library Helper.
- [JQuey]( https://jquery.com)
- [Why you might not need JQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/)
- Please be sure to use the .min version of jQuery in your projects, not the .slim version as it doesn't include all of jQuery's features
- `$("h1")[0]` to get the elements
- `$("h1")` to get the DOM Details
- With jQuery we no need to loop through all the elements selected
