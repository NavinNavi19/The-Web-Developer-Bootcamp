# Notes on RESTful Routes

- Done all the regular Express App initialization with RESTful route.
- Installed Semantic UI for the Blog app.
- `<%- %>` - It is used to include html elements evaluated in a text area.
- `substring()` to reduce the text shown in a segment
- `toDateString()` to show the complex date from db to easily readable.
- `method-override` package installed for PUT and DELETE request support.
- Used `express-sanitizer` to sanitize the inputs.
