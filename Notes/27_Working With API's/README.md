# Notes on Intro to API

- Got to know about `curl` to request for the https requests.
- New node module `request` - to get the https requests through javascripts
- Learned the use of `JSON.parse()` to parse string body data to JSON ie Javascript Objects
- Fake API with data can be found in `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`
- Debug the code using 'locus' - `npm i -D locus` and include in the line to apply breakpoint in a particular point - `eval(require('locus')`
- Also used `request-promise` to get the api data.
